-   **Express with TypeScript:** The course also equipped me with the knowledge to utilize TypeScript in conjunction with Express, enabling me to create well-structured and maintainable back-end systems.

-   **Design Patterns for Large Apps:** Understanding design patterns is crucial when working on sizable applications. Through this course, I learned how to use them.

-   **Composition and Inheritance:** I gained an understanding of the concepts of composition and inheritance, which are fundamental in creating modular and extensible codebases.
